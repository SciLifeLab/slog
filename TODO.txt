Current version
---------------

- Mail till Päivi om när funkar bättre. Affy-gruppen ?
- Bugs:
  - Search: lacking some index! tool?
  - account created must show!
- Feature
  - results: paths, links. Show!
  - driver's license: limit actions to accredited persons
  - sample location
  - project report: all that has happened
  - sample status: returned to customer
  - workset grid: show example for plating 24, 96 vs 384, combinations
  - sample upload: give prefix for consecutive numbers from XLS file
  - already plated samples: given coord in XLS file, create worksets!

- Interface
  - Immediate-response option selection for "operator" in several list views.
  - Current sample arrangement in workset is hard to understand;
    try implementing drag-and-drop.
  - Same sample must be allowed in several cells in arrangement.
  - The log doc should be viewable in same way as entity.

- Multiplex_sequence must be a direct function of multiplex_label, not
  independently changeable.
- Check: does add samples from a project to a workset work?

- Tool
  - implement check_viewable and check_editable properly
- Protocol
  - specifies steps to go through for task
- Task
  - application of a Protocol to a workset
  - optionally involves an Instrument? aux_unit?
  - status: defined, started, finished, aborted
- Sample
  - create subsample
- 'Action' class (or some such name) to perform some operation
  on an entity satisfying some criterion. Allow display of button to
  do the action (or automatic after change?), and what is to be done.

- InstrumentRun
  - report
    - select parts of run based on project
    - align with data pipeline
- Edit data for all samples in a workset simultaneously?
- Project overview
- Better CouchDB indexes for lists of entities;
  all data in a list value, rather than having to use 'include_docs'.
- Add feature 'retired' or 'archived'
  - how to do indexing?
- refactor JSON documents: references should be dicts rather than
  a simple name string, allowing use of explicit UUIDs:
  {"id": "11a082d9fac64e8dbf189bf8e3016939",
   "entity": "sample",
   "name": "P1" }
