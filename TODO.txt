To do
=====

Current version
---------------

- Operation: instead of protocol/task/tool
  - works on sample(s) via workset
  - pushes sample(s) through series of steps
  - record data, status
  - preconditions: requirements before next step can be taken
  - created/required by manager

- Fix features
  - Results: allow adding paths, links to result files/directories
  - Driver's license: account has associated protocols 'licensed'
  - project report: all that has happened
  - workset grid: show example for plating 24, 96 vs 384, combinations
  - sample upload: give prefix for consecutive numbers from XLS file
  - already plated samples: given coord in XLS file, create worksets!

- Unit tests

- Interface
  - Smaller font for field descriptions? (ReST option?)
  - Immediate-response option selection for "operator" in several list views.
  - Current sample arrangement in workset is hard to understand;
    try implementing drag-and-drop.
  - The log doc should be viewable in same way as entity.

- Multiplex_sequence should be a direct function of multiplex_label, not
  independently changeable.

- Tool
  - implement check_viewable and check_editable properly
  - show which requirements are not satisfied (except for entity type)
- Protocol
  - specify steps to go through for task
- Task
  - application of a Protocol to a workset (or to all samples from a workset?)
  - optionally involves an Instrument? aux_unit?
  - status: defined, started, finished, aborted
- Sample
  - create subsample

- Edit data for all samples in a workset simultaneously?
- Project overview
- Add field 'archived'
  - how to do indexing?
- refactor JSON documents: references should be dicts rather than
  a simple name string, allowing use of explicit UUIDs:
  {"id": "11a082d9fac64e8dbf189bf8e3016939",
   "entity": "sample",
   "name": "P1" }

Next version
------------

- Schedule: Time planning for projects, instruments, ...
  - contains Task instance with start/finish timestamps

Subsequent version
------------------

- Reagent: type of material used in a Protocol
- ReagentLot, specific batch of Reagent used according to a Protocol
